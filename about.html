        <h1>About us</h1>
        <p>Distressed by the plight of the urban poor in search of housing and livelihood in cities, in 1985 a few likeminded architects, urban planners and social workers came together to establish UDGAM</p>
        <p>UDGAM is a non-governmental organization striving since 2007 to usher in development of the destitute irrespective of caste, class, sex and religion. It mobilizes and organizes slum dwellers to improve their living conditions. We execute schemes which integrate multidimensional, multilevel, and dynamic understandings of poor people’s livelihoods</p>
        <p>UDGAM also brings together aspirations of poor people with wider sectoral, inter-sectoral, and macro-economic questions about policies necessary for realization of those aspirations. We have collaborations with local, national and international organizations and establishments whether governmental agencies or NGOs, working for similar objectives in whatever way found suitable for the achievement of the objectives to assuage the plight of the downtrodden. Our main focus in this area is on providing basic services and infrastructure to the poor, particularly in slums and informal peri-urban settlements. It takes up Socio-Economic survey of the slums in order to study the socio-economic conditions of the slum dwellers</p>
        <p>UDGAM endeavors for the development of an eco-friendly society and enable the slum dwellers to live in hygienic condition by providing basic amenities, such as drinking water, street lights, roads, drains, community bathroom, storm water drain and community halls wherever possible. UDGAM team members are sincere and dedicated to champion the cause of the marginalized and under-privileged in society. We will persistently combat to break out of the vicious circle of urban impoverishment by taking the slum for what it is an urban habitat that has deteriorated and must be rehabilitated and organized jointly with the full participation of its inhabitants. It is now in a long journey towards welfare of the society.</p>
